# Single App Template

This is a template you can clone to get started with a new single extension project. It has the .gitignore files and folder structure you will need, and there are only a few things you need to do before you can get started.

## Usage

Follow these steps to use this template:

1. Download the zip file from the "Releases" tab on GitHub, as this will not have any information on this repository OR use the "Use as template" button on this repository to create a new.
2. Generate a new GUID for the `id` field inside `app.json`. Each extension has to have a unique identifier in order to not conflict.
3. Fill in any other information in the `name`, `brief`, and `description` fields in `app.json`.
4. When finished with the above, initialise a new repository with the `git init` command, and commit all files. 
5. Create the repository on GitHub, and follow the instructions for pushing an existing repository to GitHub.
